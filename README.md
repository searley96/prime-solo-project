M.A.S.H. 2: Future Fortunes is a digital adaptation of a childhood game. Its purpose is to “predict your future”. The game has several set categories. You create your own options for each category. The only input you will not create is whether you will live in a mansion, shack, house, or apartment. When all categories and inputs have been submitted, the app will randomly select one input from each category. These selections will be displayed on a final results page for you to view.

M.A.S.H. 2: Future Fortunes is a digital adaptation of the original M.A.S.H. game, inspired by my childhood in the early 2000s. My app provides a creative and imaginative experience that invites users to envision exciting or silly possibilities for their futures. It gives users an opportunity to enjoy some nostalgia, and have some lighthearted fun.

# Built With:
React
Redux
Express
CSS
PostgreSQL
GSAP

# Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

Node.js
PostgreSQL
PostgresApp
Nodemon

# Installation
Use Postgres App to create a local Postgres instance
Use Postico to connect to your local Postgres
Create a database named in Postico named "prime_app"
The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries
Open up your editor of choice and run npm install
Run "npm run server" in your terminal
In another terminal: Run "npm run client"
The "npm run client" command will open up a new browser tab. 
- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql` - Run `npm start` - Navigate to `localhost:5000`
